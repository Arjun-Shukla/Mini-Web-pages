            "If I had to share one real secret, it would be from the early days of college. Back then, everything was
            new - the faces, the energy, the rush of it all. In the middle of that chaos, there was someone whose
            presence felt different. I didn't understand it much then, but it gave me calm, motivation, and a kind of
            warmth I couldn't explain. I never told anyone, not even myself."

        <p class="second">
            "It was probably the purest form of emotion I've ever felt. I kept it to myself, maybe because it felt right
            that way - like a secret between me and the moment it was born.‚Äù

        <p class="third">
            "It would sound like a poem - about someone who never knew they inspired one. I could never finish writing,
            like the kind of warmth that didn't need words. I never told anyone, because some emotions lose their magic
            once spoken."
